# Risk Heat Map

## File Placeholder
This is a reference placeholder for the Risk Heat Map visualization.

To create the Risk Heat Map:
1. Create a matrix visualization using Excel, PowerPoint, or dedicated tools
2. X-axis: Likelihood (Low, Medium, High)
3. Y-axis: Impact (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
4. Color-code cells based on risk level:
   - Green: Low Risk
   - Yellow: Medium Risk
   - Orange: High Risk
   - Red: Critical Risk
5. Export as PNG (Risk_Heat_Map.png) and upload to this folder

## Risk Positioning
Map identified risks from Risk_Register to appropriate cells in the heat map for visual risk prioritization.
