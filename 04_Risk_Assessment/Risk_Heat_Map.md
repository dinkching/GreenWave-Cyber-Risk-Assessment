# Risk Heat Map

## Risk Prioritization Matrix

The following table represents the risk heat map based on Likelihood and Impact scores:

### Risk Heat Map Matrix

| Likelihood \ Impact | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **High** | Medium | High | Critical | Critical |
| **Medium** | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Low** | Low | Low | Medium | High |

## Risk Positioning

Based on the Risk Register analysis:

| Risk ID | Risk Name | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Position | Color |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R10 | Web Application | High | High | 6 | High Risk | Orange |
| R20 | Data Breach | High | Critical | 12 | Critical Risk | Red |
| R30 | DDoS Attack | Medium | High | 6 | High Risk | Orange |
| R40 | Malware Infection | Medium | High | 6 | High Risk | Orange |
| R50 | Insider Threat | Low | High | 3 | Medium Risk | Yellow |

## Heat Map Legend

- **🟢 Green (Low Risk)**: Score 1-2 - Low likelihood and/or low impact. Routine controls sufficient.
- **🟡 Yellow (Medium Risk)**: Score 3-4 - Medium probability or impact. Enhanced controls recommended.
- **🟠 Orange (High Risk)**: Score 6 - High probability and/or high impact. Urgent mitigation required.
- **🔴 Red (Critical Risk)**: Score 8+ - Critical risk requiring immediate remediation and executive attention.

## Risk Trend Analysis

The majority of identified risks fall into the High and Critical categories, indicating a need for prioritized risk mitigation efforts. Critical risks should be addressed first with clear ownership and timelines established.
