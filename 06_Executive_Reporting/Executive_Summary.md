# Executive Summary

## Overview
This document provides an executive-level summary of the cybersecurity risk assessment conducted for **GreenWave Analytics Ltd.**, a fictional EU-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) organisation operating under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) obligations. The purpose of this assessment was to identify key cyber risks, evaluate their potential business impact, and recommend appropriate mitigation measures aligned with recognised security standards.

The assessment was performed as an independent academic project as part of an MSc in Cybersecurity Risk Management and simulates a real-world enterprise risk assessment engagement.

## Business Context
GreenWave Analytics Ltd. provides cloud-hosted data analytics dashboards to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The organisation processes customer personal and business data and relies heavily on the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of its SaaS platform.

Given its operational model, GreenWave faces cybersecurity risks related to:
- Protection of customer data
- Availability of online services
- Secure development and operation of web applications
- Employee access to internal systems
- Compliance with GDPR and industry best practices

---

## Assessment Scope and Approach
The assessment covered the following areas:
- Cloud-hosted SaaS application
- Customer databases containing sensitive information
- Authentication and access control systems
- Employee endpoints and internal systems
- Supporting cloud infrastructure

The methodology followed a structured approach:
1. Asset identification and classification
2. Threat modelling using the STRIDE framework
3. Risk analysis based on likelihood and impact
4. Risk prioritisation using a qualitative risk matrix
5. Mapping of key risks to ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A controls

## Key Risk Findings
The assessment identified several cybersecurity risks with varying levels of severity:

- **Critical Risk**: Risk of customer data breach due to unauthorised access or insufficient data protection controls. This risk poses significant regulatory, financial, and reputational impact.
- **High Risks**:
  - Web application vulnerabilities that could be exploited by external attackers
  - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks impacting service availability
  - Malware infections affecting employee endpoints and internal systems
- **Medium Risk**:
  - Insider threats resulting from inadequate access controls or insufficient employee awareness

These risks primarily affect data confidentiality, system availability, and regulatory compliance.

---

## Risk Prioritisation
Risks were prioritised using a likelihood × impact model and visualised through a risk heat map. One risk was classified as **Critical**, three as **High**, and one as **Medium**. High and critical risks require immediate attention and mitigation, while medium risks should be monitored and addressed through policy and awareness initiatives.

---

## Control Mapping and Mitigation Strategy
Key risks were mapped to relevant **ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A controls**, ensuring alignment with internationally recognised security standards. Recommended mitigation strategies include:

- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Secure software development practices and regular vulnerability testing
- Deployment of anti-malware and endpoint protection solutions
- Network monitoring and DDoS mitigation mechanisms
- Employee security awareness training and enforcement of least-privilege access

These controls aim to reduce risk likelihood, limit potential impact, and support regulatory compliance.

## Conclusion
This cybersecurity risk assessment highlights the importance of proactive risk management for SaaS organisations operating in regulated environments. By identifying key threats, prioritising risks, and mapping them to recognised security controls, GreenWave Analytics Ltd. can strengthen its security posture, reduce exposure to cyber incidents, and demonstrate due diligence in protecting customer data.

The outcomes of this assessment provide a clear foundation for informed decision-making and future security improvements at both technical and organisational levels.
